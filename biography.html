      <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p style="line-height:1.7em">On August 1, 1942, Julius Adekunle Ogunnariwo was born at the village of Odokujegi, Ijebu Imusin, in Ogun State, Nigeria to Mr. Joseph Adekoya Ogunnariwo and Madam Bernice Olubukunola Ogunnariwo. He was one of two boys and two girls to these parents. He attended St. Mary's Elementary School, Ijebu Imusin between 1950 and 1956. He was very brilliant, always alternating the first and second positions in his classes with his cousin, Johnson Ogundeko, in those days. In his final year at St. Mary's, he represented the School at Primary VI level at the Ijebu Imusin Progressive Society (IIPS) competition examination, comprising all elementary schools in the Ijebu Imusin community. He obtained the third prize position in the all-schools competition.</p><br>
        <br>
        <p style="line-height:1.7em">He later attended Ijebu Muslim college, Ijebu Ode, 1957-1962. At this point, his career almost came to an end due to lack of funding. Daddy Ogunnariwo, working two jobs, was not a highly educated parent, but he was determined to provide a secondary school education to all his kids. Further education beyond that level was up to the individual child. Consequently, Julius got admission to the School of Laboratory Technology, Adeoyo Hospital, Ibadan to pursue a career in Laboratory Technology as a means of getting a salary while improving himself.</p><br>
        <br>

        <p style="line-height:1.7em">In 1966, he obtained the Nigerian Federal Government Scholarship to study in England. He pursued a course in Medical Microbiology and became a Fellow of the Institute of Medical Laboratory Sciences of England in 1970. In 1968, he met his wife, Elma Eulean, while practicing as a Microbiologist and she was a Student Nurse at Lambeth Hospital, London, England. They got married in 1969 and had their first child, Busola in 1970. He proceeded to pursue an academic career in Microbiology with the British Institute of Biology, obtaining a BSc. Hons. in Microbiology in 1974. That same year, they had their second daughter, Titilayo, four months before returning to Nigeria.</p><br>
        <br>

        <p style="line-height:1.7em">He joined the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Ibadan, Nigeria, in 1975 and taught Microbiology to both Veterinary Medicine students and Medical Laboratory Science students. He mentored several students, most of whom have become Professors and Senior and Chief Medical Laboratory Scientists at the University and in other institutions. </p><br>
        <br>

        <p style="line-height:1.7em">He obtained the Master of Science Degree of the University of Ibadan in 1981 and was immediately registered in the PhD programme at the University. Between 1985 and 1986, he was at the Department of Microbiology, University of Calgary, to complete some of his PhD project. In 1988, he obtained his PhD in Microbiology, specializing in the area of Bacterial Anti Microbial Drug Resistance of Pseudomonas aeroginosa to Cephalosporines and the Amino glycosides.</p><br>
        <br>

        <p style="line-height:1.7em">In 1989, he obtained a postdoctoral position at the Department of Microbiology, University of Calgary at Dr. Tony Schryvers's laboratory. He emigrated to Canada with his wife, Elma and their four children, Busola, Titilayo, Yinka, and Jumoke. His research at Dr. Tony Schryvers' laboratory focused on developing vaccines for the prevention and eradication of various diseases in animals and man. In this respect, he worked conscientiously and not only succeeded in developing the vaccines for the treatment of pneumonic fever in cattle, but his research findings led to the application of these vaccines in the prevention of a number of human diseases, notably bacterial meningitis especially in children. He was author of several publications and patented a number of vaccines with Dr. Schryvers. But, being a born entrepreneur, Julius had always wanted to be in business. Previously, while at the University of Ibadan, he had run a very popular night club, Club Safari and Boutique Safari. He later became a female and male fashion designer, operating under the label SAF Fashions.</p><br>
        <br>

        <p style="line-height:1.7em">So, in the year 2000, after he had completed the educational training of his four daughters, he 'jumped' back into business to fulfill his passion. He considered Financial Planning and Real Estate as options but settled for a Real Estate career. It was a wise choice because, as Julius has always said, 'everybody needs a roof over his/her head'. In 2000, he joined the defunct Realty Executives Chinook City as a Real Estate Agent. Within the first 8 months, he became the number three Top Real Estate Agent out of about 68 Agents in that office </p><br>
        <br>
        <p style="line-height:1.7em">This performance triggered some jealousy from other Agents. Consequently, in 2001, Julius moved to Remax Central, the Number One Remax Office worldwide, for Four consecutive Years, at that time. It has since become the Number One Remax Office worldwide for the past Thirteen Years. Julius wanted a challenge in a high performing office, and he got it. In his first year at the office, he was in #68 positions out of just over 200 Agents. </p><br>
        <br>

        <p style="line-height:1.7em">A few years later, the two Remax Central offices were joined together by the same owners, increasing the number of Agents to close to 300 in the same office. But Julius through hard work has found a way to become one of the first 20 Top Producers in that office on a number of occasions, in a Top Producing office, ReMax Central. He has won several Real Estate Awards in record times and he has won an award every year of his real estate practice. Among his career record achievements are:</p>
        <br>
        <ul class="award-list">
        <p>
          <li>Million Dollar Club, Calgary Real Estate Board - 2006 (In 6 Years of Practice)</li>
        <br>
          <li>Platinum Club ReMax International - 2006 (In 6 Years of Practice) </li>
        <br>
          <li>Hall of Fame, ReMax International - 2008 (In 8 Years of Practice)</li></ul>
        <br>

        <h3 style="line-height:1.7em">Awards every year include :</h3>
          <li style="color: #bba14f">100% Club, ReMax International (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 20010, 2011).</li><br>
        <br>

        <p style="line-height:1.7em">Dr. Julius Ogunnariwo is a man of different parts and means different things to different people. A very happily married man to his wife, a caring father to his children and a loving grandfather to his eight grandchildren. He is very caring to his extended family, always attending to their individual and collective problems, financially and socially. He remains an active and a financial member of his village church at Ijebu Imusin and the Chapel of Resurrection, University of Ibadan, respectively. He is currently an active member of the Beddington Pentecostal Church, NW Calgary.</p> <br>
        <br>     

        <p style="line-height:1.7em">In Calgary, he is a well respected community leader in the Nigerian and African communities as well as in the Calgary community, in general. He was a founding member of the Nigerian Canadian Association of Calgary (NCAC) and remains a very committed member of the association. In his 5 years Presidency of that Association, he raised the profile of the organization to become the best run community organization in Calgary. He continues to support the association financially, socially and mentor its executives. Dr.O, as he is popularly known in the African community in Calgary, has helped a lot of Nigerian families arriving in Calgary to settle down successfully both in terms of temporary and permanent accommodation, but continue to provide them fatherly advice and mentorship. His virtue of live and let live, has become his hallmark.</p><br>
        <br>
        
        <p style="line-height:1.7em">Recently, he started to promote the leadership culture of respect among Nigerians in Alberta, to remind us of the ways elders are treated with respect by the younger folks. In this creation, Nigerian adults are categorized into the ELD, ELDER and ELDEST groups. The ELD is a male/female between the ages of 40 and 49. He/she becomes an ELDER at age 50. To earn the ELDER Certificate, he must celebrate in a public gathering to host some ELDERS and ELDESTS, amongst other guests in that setting. An individual that turns 60 becomes an ELDEST (Regular) and is recognized by the Committee of ELDERS and ELDESTS, with a Certificate, if he celebrates publicly, as noted before. An individual that turns 70 is an ELDEST (Premium), if he celebrates in a public place, as noted before, and is as such welcomed with a framed Certificate, duly signed by the President and Secretary of the Club. In all cases, basement celebrations are not counted as public place celebrations and the certificate is not issued, even if some ELDERS and ELDESTS groups do attend such parties. As Dr. O, turns a new chapter in life, we wish him good health and long life.<br>
